# to-do-list
The server listens for HTTP GET and POST requests on different routes, and responds by rendering an EJS template or adding a new item to a list, respectively. The script uses the 'express' module to create the server and define routes, the 'body-parser' module to parse the request body and make the POST data available to the server via the 'req.body' object, and the 'ejs' module to render an HTML page with embedded JavaScript using a template. The script defines two arrays, 'items' and 'workItems', which are used to store the to-do list items for the home page and work page, respectively. The script also requires an additional module called 'date.js' which appears to be used to get the current day of the week. The server listens for connections on port 3000 and logs a message to the console when it is started.
